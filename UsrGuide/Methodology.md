# Methodology
This methodology builds on the method proposed by Fitton et al. (2021), which was based upon the methodologies of Kazmierczak et al. (2015), Lindley & O’Neil (2013), and Lindley (2011) and focused on social vulnerability to environmental hazards in Ireland. The updated methodology focuses on specific hazards and proposes a set of potential indicators available for different European cities and regions (including Cork City, Ireland, Logroño and the La Rioja Region in Spain and Milan in Italy), derived through detailed discussions with local authorities and the exploration of the most up to date national census data and Copernicus data under the REACHOUT project.  and integrates them as proposed by Fitton et al. (2021) in a hierarchy scheme, grouping the indicators into domains and collating the domains to create the dimensions of social vulnerability (sensitivity, adaptive capacity and enhanced exposure). This work is also being further progressed through the Directed project,. which aims to reduce vulnerability to extreme weather events and foster disaster-resilient European societies, and through the TALX2 project which aims to support and progress climate adaptation activities on the island of Ireland using place-based partnerships. Case studies from these projects include the areas of Rimini, Italy (Directed) and Northern Ireland (TALX2). As proposed by Fitton et al. (2021) indicators are integrated into a hierarchy scheme. Indicators are grouped into domains, with Z-scores for each domain summed with an equal weighting for the spatial area used. The domains are then collated and associated with dimensions of social vulnerability (sensitivity, adaptive capacity and enhanced exposure). Through this research changes were made to the Fitton et al. (2021) methodology, in particular through the use of hazard specific indicators for the dimensions of vulnerability and the inclusion of the housing characteristics Additionally, the domain in the adaptive capacity dimension, as well as the of housing characteristics., which Fitton et al. (2021) had grouped under only the enhanced exposure dimension (Fig. 1), as severalhas indicators that were found to consideredbe relevant to the adaptive capacity dimension (Table 1).  as well and have now been included in both (Fig. 1).

Based on the specific hazard risk and local and national data availability, different indicators were used in each of the regionss. At least one indicator providing information on the dimensions of sensitivity, adaptive capacity (including ability to prepare, ability to respond, ability to recover) and enhanced exposure, was considered necessary for the creation of an SVI score. Wherever possible, providing a range of indicators for each domain was considered the best approach, allowing for a more robust vulnerability score and subsequent map output. The tbables below show the different levels of data availability in different national contexts and the rationale behind specific indicator selection (Tables 1, 2 & 3).

## Weighted approaches 
A new set of weighting methodologies are also proposed, combining the domains of vulnerability in a different way to form the overall social vulnerability index score.
Based on the set of indicators identified for the different case studies and in how these are grouped into several domains, a new set of weighted approaches areis proposed. The methodology proposed by Fitton et al. (2021) assigned equal weights to each domain and distributed the weight of the indicators based inon the numbers of these ones for each domain. In this way, each As outlined in Fitton et al. (2021) each of the domains (Fig. 1) has equal weighting, however, in the updated methodology if a domain does not have available indicators, it is assigned a null value. Each of the domains is considered an important element for determining social vulnerability and each indicator is havinghas an equal value into the relevant domain., howeverHowever, in practice some cities and regions may not have the information necessary for a wide range of indicators to inform all ofall the information domains. In areas where a single indicator may be representing an entire may not benot have enough indicators available to cities and regions, . In this circumstance, where someor for some cases where there is a reduced numbers ofcausing  domains and or dimension, s are presenting with  a single indicators the distribution of the weightings could be disproportionate. , and aiming to avoid disproportionate weights for these indicators, a set of rules and methodologies are proposed in the calculation of their weights. This ensures that all municipal actors and organisations can still avail of the SVI tool, even where there is a lack of available data for a wide range of indicators. This will also allow users who have detailed hazard maps of an area to enter a null value in the physical environment domain, and utilise their own hazard information, while still retaining all the other valuable information produced by the SVI (e.g. removing greenspace and impervious surface data which may already be included in hazard maps, while retaining information on housing characteristics).  Additionally, forAn good example of a disproportionate weight into a domain wcould be the case where, in  the age domain, of age, the null value is also imposed where  is missing key information is missing for either the population over the age of seventy-five or under the age of five (or substitute indicators) are missing so that neither one of these factors can dominatecontrols the domain and there is, an unbalancing theed domain and potentially the dimensionwith lac and creating an overall z-score of vulnerability that may be biased towards a single indicator k of key information. 
With the aim to avoid disproportionate weights for these cases, a set of rules and methodologies are proposed in the calculation of their weights. This ensures that all municipal actors and organizations can still avail of the SVI tool, even where there is a lack of available data for a wide range of indicators. The rules are based on the different case studies explored under this study and they should be used as a guidance to decide the best weighting methodology. 

Rules for Domain Weightings
Do we need to add how we apply the null weighting to domains here?
	 
Rules for Indicator WeightingsWeighting methodologies proposed:
Based on the information available for the cities under analysis and in the limitations related to the number of indicators and domains for some particular cases we proposed a set of weighted methodologies for the indicators used in the calculation of the final vulnerability index. 

Case 1: This case is representingrepresents the ideal scenario where there a’re at least two domains per dimension and each domain contains indicators representing the whole population vulnerable to the hazard. For this scenario we proposed to estimate the weights coefficients based on the number of indicators of each domain. Then for each domain the coefficients are equally distributed between the indicators and the sum of those are equal to 1. 
Then the whole vulnerability index is then estimated cumulating all the relevant indicators with the weights coefficients estimated troughthrough the domains. See equation 1. 

SVI= norm(∑_1^n▒∑_1^m▒〖W_mn*〖ind〗_m)〗 Equation 1
W_mn= 1/m

Where SVI is the vulnerability index, indm  is the mth indicator, m is the total number of indicators for each n domain, and Wmn is the weight of the mth indicator for the nth domain.  

Case 2: This second scenario is considering the cases with domains with single indicators or where there is a lack of information related to missing indicators. For these domains the weights are halved. See equation 2. 

SVI= norm(∑_1^n▒∑_1^m▒〖W_mn*〖ind〗_m)〗 Equation 2
W_mn= {█(1/2m  if m=1 or missing key indicators@1/m   otherwise)┤
Where SVI is the vulnerability index, indm  is the mth indicator, m is the total number of indicators for each n domain, and Wmn is the weight of the mth indicator for the nth domain.  

Case 3: This third scenario is considering the cases where there is only a single domain in any of the three main dimension. On these cases the methodology applied to calculating the weighting coefficient is the same of the second case, but the final index is considered less robust and based on the dimension with less information, some consideration should be taken before to take any decision based on the vulnerability index. 

Case 4: This last case is considering the cases where there are dimensions without domains and then the approach needs to be redefined, and the robustness of the index is highly affected. This approach is useful to estimate vulnerability information related to social aspects, but we are not considering this as a Social Vulnerability Index. 
 For this case we proposed a statistical approach based only in the indicators available and not taking into consideration the domains. With the aim to have a more robust index that effectively captures the underlying patterns in the data we proposed to use a Principal Component Analysis (PCA). 
When calculating vulnerability indices, multicollinearity among indicators can lead to biased results, as highly correlated features may disproportionately influence the overall index. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is an effective dimensionality reduction technique that addresses this issue by transforming a set of correlated indicators into a smaller number of uncorrelated principal components (PCs).
The primary purpose of PCA in calculating vulnerability indices is to reduce multicollinearity by transforming correlated indicators into orthogonal components, thereby eliminating redundancy caused by collinearity. Additionally, PCA simplifies the dataset by identifying the minimum number of components that explain the maximum variance, ensuring the focus remains on the most significant features while discarding noise or less-informative indicators. Furthermore, the contribution of each indicator to the principal components can be utilized to derive weight coefficients, ensuring that the importance of correlated features is appropriately distributed.
To derive weight coefficients for calculating vulnerability indices, the process begins with generating a correlation matrix for all indicators to evaluate their relationships and identify potential multicollinearity. This matrix highlights strong positive or negative correlations, which can result in redundancy. The next step involves performing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) using the correlation matrix as input. PCA transforms the original correlated indicators into uncorrelated principal components, addressing the redundancy and collinearity issues.
Once the PCA is performed, the proportion of total variance explained by each principal component is extracted. These variance proportions indicate the relative importance of each component in representing the dataset's information. To ensure components that explain more variances have a greater influence, the values of each principal component are weighted by its corresponding variance proportion. Finally, a weighted mean approach can be used, where the weight coefficients derived from PCA are applied to calculate the final vulnerability score for each area. This approach ensures all indicators contribute appropriately to the index, avoiding disproportionate influence of highly correlated features while retaining the essential variability of the dataset.
